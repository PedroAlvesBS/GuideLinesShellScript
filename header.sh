#  This program receives a user's login as a parameters and
#  searchs in some sources what are thir full name, returning 
#  the result in the standard output (STDOUT).
#
# Examples:
#   $ ./full_name.sh joseph
#   Joseph Smith
#   $ ./full_name.sh josephhh
#   $
#
# The order of full name searching is sequential:
#
#  1. File /etc/passwd
#  2. File $HOME/.plan
#  3. LDAP Users source
#  4. MySQL Users source
#
# The first result found is returned, according to the search order.
