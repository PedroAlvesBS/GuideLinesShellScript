# Bash Guidelines 

There are some differences between a script and a program. In a nutshell:

## Script:
Something made in a hurry, without paying attention to details and not worrying about future modifications.

## Program
Structured following guidelines and quality control, planned and ready to be enhanced and upgraded.

This repository was created to help me remember these guidelines when creating programs :). Some examples are taken from "Shell Script Profissional - Aurélio Marinho Jargas"
(Perhaps you will never see, but you taught me a lot Aurélio)
